# Owen Leigh Piico Pi Mechatronics Project

Wall Detecting Robot Using OOP Systems

## Description

This project presents a prototype developed using OOP. Its main goal was to build a basic robot capable of object and color detection. The codebase features multiple classes organized through layered inheritance.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

- Describe any prerequisites, libraries, OS version, etc., needed before installing program.
- Requires at least Windows 10/equivelant MacOS
- Python Libraires: servo.py, PiicoDev_Ultrasonic

### Installing

- Program is downloadable from github
- No changes are neccasary for files to run if the files are unaltered

### Executing program

- Connect Piico Pi to computer
- Soft Reset Piico Pi
- Upload project into Piico Pi
- Run `Movement.py` file
- Robot runs until hardware fail (e.g. batteries dying)

## Help

Run Unit Tests to diagnose potential issues within robot's movement and ultrasonic software

Issues may occur in complicated environments restricting movement
